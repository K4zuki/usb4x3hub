## KNOWN ISSUE
### [ IC1 ] pin24 connection to VDD makes the IC in 2-port HUB mode
* cut pattern and connect to GND instead (e.g. bridge with p23)
* fixed in r0.2

### [ IC1 ] pin32 is directly connected to VDD while the pin is output function
* cut pattern and connect by pullup resistor instead
* fixed in r0.2

### [ U1 ] U1 will not respond on SW3 and SW4 as P0_10 and 11 do not have internal pullup
* **_Critical:_ this limits number of hosts**
* fixed in r0.2
