## KNOWN ISSUE
### [ IC1/Q1 ] Q1 designed to use 48MHz _crystal_ while IC1 only requires _oscillator_(of 48MHz)
1. REMOVE C4, C21, Q1
1. cut pattern of pin29/IC1
1. cut pattern between pins 2 and 4 of Q1
1. connect pin1 and 4 of Q1 to 3.3V
1. connect pin31/IC1 to GND
1. place 6MHz Oscillator such as CTX974CT-ND(Digikey)
